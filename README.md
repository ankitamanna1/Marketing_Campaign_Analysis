I developed an interactive dashboard that is helpful to identify key insights:

I used pie chart and map based visualisation showing cost per conversion, ROI, and engagement rate across different cities.
**2.	Channel-Wise Performance:**
Comparative bar charts, column charts for Facebook and Pinterest highlighting cost per conversion and ROI.
**3.	Device-Wise Engagement:**
I used decomposition tree for comparing engagement rates on desktop and mobile for various platforms, and channel accessed with that devices,
**4.	Quarterly Campaign Trends:**
Trend lines showing spend and conversion rates across Q1 and Q4.

I checked CTR%, spend, and effectiveness of discount vs. non-discount ads with a comparative table.

•	Birmingham offers the highest ROI and engagement rate.
•	Pinterest outperforms Facebook in ROI despite lower spend.
•	Desktop ads and Instagram have the highest engagement rates.
